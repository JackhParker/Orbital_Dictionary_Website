# Orbital_Dictionary_Website
The First group project in creating a functioning website with apis.

# Collaborators 
    Abdirahman, Adam, Jack, Yazid

# Function
    The plan for the website is to act as a library for those who wish to learn more about the solar system, with quick simple UI and the ability to search both through a nav bar and a  search bar for  more info. The site also has two buttons one for a random fact to learn something new every day, and the other for learning more about the background picture from the NASA Daily picture API, which will change daily to the most recent photo from the api.

# WebSite description

It is designed to give info a over 300 celestial bodies in our solar system, the home page offers a background photo for nasa and its public API's with a button for more info, and another button for a random bodies facts.
